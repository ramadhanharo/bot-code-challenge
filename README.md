# Bot Battlr

Bot Battlr is a React web application that allows users to view and manage a collection of bots. Users can add bots to their army, release them from their army, and even discharge them (delete from both the army and backend).

## Features

- Bot Collection: Displays a list of available bots.
- Add to Army: Add a bot to your personal army by clicking the "Add to Army" button.
- Release from Army: Release a bot from your army.
- Discharge Bot: Permanently discharge a bot from your army and the backend, which deletes the bot forever.
- Catchphrase: Each bot has a unique catchphrase and other stats like health, damage, and armor.

## Technologies Used

- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- JSON Server: A fake REST API to simulate a backend server.
- Fetch API: To fetch bot data from a remote server and interact with the backend.
- CSS: Basic styling for the app.
